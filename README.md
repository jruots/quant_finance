# quant_finance
Python scripts based on quantitative finance.

The rmim_weights_for_10_7_2017 is an example script that can be used to calculate the weight for a 6-1 risk-managed momentum strategy. You have to simply import a csv of you choosing with stock price data for the past 6 months for the winner portfolio. The script then calculates the weight for your risk-managed long only momentum strategy for the next month.
